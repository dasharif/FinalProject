AgeAndBMIviolin is a supplementary figure visualizing the patients in period 1, comparing their age to their BMI. However, a strip and box plot seemed a more appropriate method of visualizing my demographic information, so AgeandBMIboxstrip and AgeandBMIboxstripPERIOD3 were created. I used both in my final analysis because the demographic information could easily change ove the course of 18 years. Demo table and Demo table 3 are tables that demonstrate the demographic information of the participants at the start of the study compared to the end. Last CVDandBMI is a box plot overlaid by a strip plot used before my independent t test to ensure there were no outliers before conducting the test.
